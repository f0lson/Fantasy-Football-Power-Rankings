                <p>Another week goes by and another win gets chalked up for the Ranch Me Brotendos.  This team has been the team to beat from the get go.  Fortunately for RMB’s, only one slag was able to sneak one out against him.  Hopefully, those two play each other again so someone can stay true to their name (repeat).  Melvin Gordon lead the team with a break out 33 pts, followed by Michael Thomas chipping in 21.5pts, and new acquisition Jordy Nelson with 16.5pts (Should we just pay him now!?).  I think it’s safe to say that it’s very tough to lose when only one of your players scores in the single digits, but I wouldn’t know anything about that.  RMB’s are a force to reckon with, but injuries are the worst late in the season…</p>

                <p>The Butt Tuggers sure did seal this one up quick.  Mike Evans sure helped out by leading this team with a monster 32.5pts (Definitely should have traded him for a prime running back if you had the chance to), Matt Forte putting up a respectable 15.5pts, and then the rest of the team isn’t worth mentioning….  However, the bench players are! The scoreboard sealed BT’s victory, but managing this squad like he is could run him into the ground come playoff time.  Leaving 25.5 pts off of the scoreboard can leave a window for better teams to take advantage of (sorry bortletortle).  The Boys have been rolling on offense and the Browns D have been dismal at best.  You have to wonder if Tugg was taking managerial advice from Joe Madden (sorry again).</p>

                <p>It seemed like The Trumpster Fires’ team of misfits finally ran into a week of stagnation, but a break out showing from Wilson with 26pts allowed the team to sprint to the finish line.  Julio chipped in with 21 pts and Olsen with 13.5 pts.  The rest of the team is barely worth mentioning, but it was enough to get past DD.  Maybe a revitalized Wilson can be the game changer in playoffs, but time will tell.  Unfortunately, next week Julio and Freeman will be on BYE, but Larry Fitz, Dalton, and Palmer will be available.  Little bit of managing to do next week to get past The QCS.  Godspeed Trumpster Fires (low key miss you in the GroupMe and lower key in real life).</p>

                <p>The QC Savages manager didn’t have much hope in his team going into this week.  That statement is proven by the newly acquired players that now have to shamefully display QCS on their jerseys….  From the bench…..  I guess QCS didn’t want to Bease with Ease and he didn’t want a FreeW with T-W. (The points ended up not mattering, but I wanted to make a splash (mission accomplished)) QCS could have been in one of the MNF “Down To The Wire Matchups” with a 1v1 -5 pts if he would have stayed on the Trade Hype Train(THT) just a couple days longer.  However, kind of didn’t want to mention this, but if QCS never got on the THT, a Frank Gore would have boosted him up 12pts.  AND ALL THAT DIDN’T MATTER EITHER!  The fantasy gods were rooting for the Savages this week because Jimmy Graham had a breakout game with 26 pts.  Is this the Seattle that everyone has been waiting for?  Let’s hope so for the Savages’ sake.  Another positive note is that QCS have their big guns coming back next week.  Despite all the managerial miscues this week, watch out for the Savages, because they are trending up at the right time.</p>

                <p>Sitting 4-4 with a hot Cleveland Steamer creeping up behind him, DD needed a fucking win!  BUT! It didn’t fucking happen…  This week’s matchup was more about concussion protocol, “Questionable” tags, and waiver wire balancing than The Trumpster Fire’s projected points.  DD had a gut check this week and he fought through it, but he decided to go for the sure thing rather than take a chance at glory.  McCoy became available only Monday night and Cobb became available around 1pmCT after DD had already set his lineup.  The Gods were laughing at DD this week and to be honest with you, I can’t blame them.  Breesy like Sunday Morning lead the team with 24 followed by AB with 17.5.  Waiver pickups: Ebron, Sproles, and Lambo added another 33 pts.  Quite the ménage à trois.  DD will have Shady, Eifert, and Ware available next week, so watch out Bortletortles, DD is looking to sling. (DD is definitely (maybe) a lock for the playoffs)</p>

                <p>Wow! I am just now looking at KTL’s squad and just wondering how does he lose? Then I looked as PF and realized he is dead fucking last.  How?  I got curious, so I went into the transaction counter.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  Great fucking draft KTL really picked up some good guys! (Seriously. Good Draft)  Then!!! It is all downhill from there... Drops Vinatieri, Literal #1 kicker in the league. Drops Christine Michael, #14 RB. Drops Jason Witten for Jamison Crowder! Good Move!? Drops Jamison Crowder for Hunter Henry? Ok? Ok! Drops Sammy Watkins for Crowder! Yes! Drops Crowder for Tavon Austin. WTF man? Seriously. Wtf? I can’t continue.  How did DD lose to you? Ew.  You didn’t make a trade till last week.  You could have gotten quality players for players you just dropped… And now those players are picked up by other teams that are now the reason why you are DFL in PF.  I don’t even want to do you write up anymore.  His players did stuff and scored points.  He isn’t losing his starters to BYE next week.   Just EWWWWWWW. You’re bad and you should feel bad. And fucking drop CJ Anderson already. He is on IR ffs.</p>

                <p>Toted “Playoff Lock” by Groupme resident God Caleblol.  The CS just might have enough in the tank to continue shitting over the bubble team’s playoff hopes.  Gutsy call starting Colin Kaep (21pts)over Big Dick Dak(23pts *Bench*) playing the Browns, Jay Ajayi(19.5 pts) continues to run over, through, and around everyone, but it was all irrelevant because he was playing Fantasy Extraordinaire Chicken Wing.  I think the league hates both of these guys the most.  Cut off Mann from The CS and block Reddit.com/r/FantasyFootball from CW and I think the standings would be a lot different this year.  The Commissioner is going to have to think about regulations with all the heat he is getting from the other owners.  Would not want to have that job.  Anyway, The CS get, well, pretty much all his dick slingers back next week: Brady, Alshon(Jay is BACK!), and the duel threat Hill/Bernard combo.  The CS have Diggs Gon’ Digg next week and their only saving grace is that The CS will be without Amari Cooper.  Good Luck DGD, everyone is rooting for you.</p>

                <p>NECC isn’t the only thing new on this team.  Let’s start with, oh I don’t know, how about everything!?!?  Completely CLEANED HOUSED, REVAMPED, OVERHAULED!  Sounds like a god damn Fire Sale!  No one was safe on the team previously known as the “Baja Men” except T.Y. Hilton and Coby Fleener, but it was not for a lack of effort.  NECC tried to push TY like a pimp does a walking coozie, but The DD weren’t having any sloppy seconds.  If you take away the heartbreaking loss this week and take a look at this manager’s moves, you will be able to see that this guy will do whatever it takes to get a “W.”  I don’t care how much you hate him, but you got to respect him.  He traded for S.S. Sr., Big Ben, Girl on Seattle, D. Thomas, Gore, and Ryan Mathews.  Only to drop Mathews for James Starks who will probably be available for Week 10!  This guy makes fucking moves!  I am not even going into the waivers and free agency because I don’t have the time nor the space. Big Ben lead with 18pts followed by the Chargers D with 14pts.  NECC must have been tired from all the moves he made because he left Frank Gore on the bench with 20pts (He might have gotten Ty Montgomery confused with TY Hilton) < oops like that will cost you in playoffs NECC, lock it up and you just might make it down the long road.  Word to the wise: Montgomery is a WR filling in at RB... InGOREge yourself!!! BUT! Not next week because him and TY are on BYE</p>

                <p>DGD lost a heartbreaker this week.  But he tied!? Yes, he did tie, but the tiebreaker is bench points, so he loses.  Maybe, just maybe, when players are on IR, you should drop them and pick up a QB or something.  Especially when your opponent still has a guy on IR on his bench as well!   Don’t worry DGD, it happens to the best managers.  Do not hang your head, because you played your heart out.  You maximized your output and used every possible point you could have used.  Efficiency is tough to come by in this league, but you were born with that gift.   DGD’s playoffs hopes are quite slim, but the Cubs did the World Series this year, so I am not ruling anything out.  Murray led the team with 30.5 pts, followed by ARodg with 25pts, and Diggs with a respectable 15.5pts.  Losing Murray to BYE next week, but Gronka Truck and Kelley will be available.  Keep up the efficiency on output and let the other teams make the mistakes. Play your game DGD.  DGD Down but not (diggs) OUT!</p>

                <p>The Bortletortles have got to be kicking themselves in the shells this week.  Came down to one move.  One crucial move that could have been the difference maker.  Mike Wallace over Marvin Jones. BOOM 19.5 extra points which would have bested The BT by 1.5 pts.  Would have been a huge upset!  The opportunity was there!  BT left 25.5pts usable points on the bench!  If the The Bortletortles can make a run here late in the season, they surely will be thinking about this game in the offseason.  Bortles led the team with 21pts, followed by Beckham Jr. with 18pts, but that wasn’t enough to secure Beckham’s roster spot.  HE GONE!  Some might say The Bortletortles are getting desperate, but I think this guy has a few managerial tricks up his sleeve.  The Bortletortles have Cooks, TY, Forte, and Fleener coming in for a big matchup for DD and The Bortletortles.  Definitely going to be a close one.  Only player on BYE next week (that is worth mentioning) is TY.</p>
