Monster outings from Abdullah and Jordan Matthews ensured that extra player (and John Brown tossing out an abysmal 0.5 points) would not be an issue. Tevin Coleman (Lolz fuq Freeman) and Kelvin Benjamin both punched above their projected totals to comfortably take down the Steamers.

Known as one of the league's biggest risk taker, the Cleveland Steamers decided to start Jonathan Stewart versus the Broncos instead of Doug Baldwin who was taking on a very weak Miami secondary. As you can already guess, it didn't pay off. Derek Carr and Amari Cooper showed promise with their Week 1 performances. While Week 2 has just begun, the Steamers are already attempting to climb themselves out of a 30 point deficit thanks to the Butt Tuggers and Matt Forte.</p>

                <p>Webster's Dictionary defines 'shit' as: "waste matter discharged from the bowels after food has been digested; excrement." Hester's Heckler's Week 1 performance was literally shit. A monster week for Dez Bryant saw him reel in a massive 0.5 points! Gio Bernard decided that he wanted to give Mr. Bryant a run for his money and chipped in with an inspired 3 point outing against the NY Jets. ODBHJ added to the disappointment by only netting 9.5 points, well below his projected score. Jordan Reed and Blake "The Bortortle" Bortles were the two highest scorers for Hester's Hecklers with 12 and 14 points. Week 2 sees the Hecklers head-top-head with the equally disappointing QC Savages in the Matchup of the Week! Anything can happen!</p>
