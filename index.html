                <p>In the fantasy game of the week, The Ants in My Eye Johnson’s flexed on the Butt Tuggers’ ass.  Mother Fucker Jones’ 35 points helped Johnson easily get the ‘W’. Looking up and down Johnson’s roster, there is no doubt he has an unreal team. No surprise there though, you've always been excellent at picking up good men. Even your fucking bench looks solid…I guess you're also really talented at finding guys to plug your holes! If finding men to fill all your cracks at once was a job, you’d be the #1 prospect ya dick. To summarize Johnsons’ season thus far, I am the captain now.</p>

Despite scoring less than 100 points, the Savages were able to knock off the handicapped Dean Sampson. Heck when Jarvis Landry’s 22 points is a third of your opponent’s overall score though, you should be in pretty good shape!
