                <p>It's beginning to get extremely lonely at the top. New week, same ol' story. No one man should have all this power. The Ants In My Eyes Johnsons (TAIMEJ) made light work of the toothless Bortletortles (formerly The Hester's Hecklers) winning by a comfortable margin of 73.5 points and raking in an impressive 151 points. The match up was pretty much wrapped up Thursday night after Jordy Nelson decided this would be the perfect week to fuck all of Kevin's hopes and dreams. Melvin Gordon continued his excellent season by dropping 32 points against the ever-so-shitty Atlanta Falcons' defense. TAIMEJ brilliantly stacked Candy Andy Dalton and AJ Green for their favorable match up against the Cleveland Browns, and it paid dividends with a total of 46 points (20 for Candy &amp; 26 for AJG). Week 8 is looking more and more like an automatic win as TAIMEJ faceoff against the broken Kirk The Lurk.</p>

Andrew Luck and Mike Evans (who he should totally trade to TAIMEJ for Marvin Jones and Travis Benjamin which is completely and 100% a fair deal...) both had fantastic weeks with 27 and 25 points respectively, while Matt Jones tore it up with a monster Sunday tallying up 0 whole points! The Bills D/ST tried to fuck everything over with a brilliant -5 point outing. But once the Butt The Butt Tuggers will face off against the Trumpster Fires in the Battle For Second Place in Week 8.

                <p>With both Dez and Shady on the bench known pants-pooper Nate DuBois' effort to defeat the beautiful Ryan fell short this week. An otherwise average week from the Dez Dispensers was buoyed by the stellar performances of Drew Brees (24 points), Spencer Ware (19 points), and Randall Cobb (22.5 points). Antonio Brown had an extremely off week which is saying a lot because he still racked up a more than solid 14.5 points. A healthy Dez Bryant should help bolster the Dez Dispensers' chances of success versus the QC Savages in Week 8. The Dez Dispensers have only scored below 100 points once this season, so it's safe to assume that they'll be 5-3 by this time next week.</p>

                <p>In what was touted as a pivotal matchup for the race for the playoffs, the QC Savages fell short in their quest to defeat the Butt Tuggers. Week 7 saw another average sub-100 point performance for the QC Savages who seem content to sit in either 4th or 5th place for the remainder of the season. With 3 players featuring in the Monday night game, it was crucial that the Savages keep the score as close as they possibly could throughout the Sunday games. Isaiah Crowell, Michael Crabtree (2016's Eric Decker), Philip Rivers, Jarvis Landry, and surprise pickup Vernon Davis all chipped in to keep the deficit between the Savages and the Tuggers at a doable 33 points for the do-or-die Monday Night Football game. Unfortunately for Garebear, the Brocketship was fully malfunctioning and DeAndre Hopkins was only able to reel in 5.5 points courtesy of the stout Denver D which scored a respectable 10 points. Lamar Miller's injury proved to be decisive as he was only able to muster a disappointing 7.5 points in a must-win game for the QC Savages. They will try and bounce back Week 8 against an Antonio Brown-less Dez Dispensers.</p>

                <p>WHO LET THE MUTHAFUCKIN' DAWGS OUT?! This is his world, and we're all just living in it. Manager extraordinaire Ryan and The Baja Men continued their climb up the #FuckDean power rankings. Waiver wire pick up of the week Ty Montgomery got things kicked off in a bittersweet fashion on Thursday night with 17 points against Ryan's beloved Bears. Leading the way in scoring this week was the great Eugene "T.Y." Hilton who balled the fuck out with 22.5 points, and the NY Giants D/ST chipped in with a fantastic 20 points of their own (cuz London, duh). Unfortunately, a Hunter Henry concussion cut his game short after only accumulating 1.5 points, but he looks healthy and good to go for Week 8. You have to respect the blind loyalty the Baja Men showed by deciding to play Jeremy Maclin once again even though the offense is dominated by Spencer Ware and the run game. Two in-form teams will square off in Week 8 as the Baja Men will be visited by the Cleveland Steamers.</p>

                <p>Blind loyalty has been the theme of The Bortletortles' season thus far, and that theme has continued in to Week 7. Only 4 players (Blake Bortles, Jack Doyle, Emmanuel Sanders, and Justin Tucker) broke single digits scores for the week. Jordy Nelson literally shit his pants Radney Ultimo style during Thursday night football against a questionable Chicago Bears secondary and finished with a lowly 0.5 points on 1 catch for 9 yards. The Bortletortles' woes continued on Sunday morning with a mediocre 6.5 outing from ODBHJ (because London, duh), and a combined 11 points from running backs Christine Michael and Jerick McKinnon (Vikings down baby!) leading The Bortletortles to the lowest score of Week 7 with 77.5. While Week 7 was disastrous for the Bortletortles, they have every reason to be optimistic going in to Week 8 against a Ryan Irwin-less Diggs Gon Digg.</p>

                <p>I don’t even know what to say.  The Carolina Panthers were just in the fucking Super Bowl and outside of getting rid of the most overrated corner in the NFL, they have managed to digress like crazy and were good enough for -6 points!  The blind loyalty to Bortles still hasn’t managed to pan out, and although he played the miserable Bears, only mustering 10 points didn’t help the cause.  #FeastMode continues to disappoint without having registered a rushing touchdown this year, along with Emmanuel Sanders getting outscored by Cole Beasley on the bench puts the Hecklers into a tough spot moving forward.  On the plus side, diva boy ODBJ finally proposed to that fucking net while making strides with 36 points, but it was too little too late against the high flying Steamers this week.</p>

Was 9/11 an inside job? These are all questions we hope to learn the answers to soon. Week 7 was - unfortunately - another week to forget for Kirk The Lurk and his band of misfit players. Ezekiel Elliot's bye week couldn't have come at a worse time for the struggling Lurks who were barely able to crack 80 points this week. The good news for the Lurks was that even while splitting carries with Devontae Booker, CJ Anderson was still able to produce 16 points against a stout Houston D. The bad news? CJA tore his meniscus and is done for the season. Golden Tate had a respectable outing with 12 points which prompted Kirk The Lurk to immediately drop him as there's no room for overachievers in this squad. The Ants In My Eyes Johnsons and ex-girlfriends DeMarco Murray &amp; Delanie Walker are Kirk the Lurk's opponents Week 8, and it's not looking too positive for them. The Lurks comeback might have to be postponed to Week 9.</p>

                <h2>Caleb's Lolnge:</h2>
                <p>You know that picture online of the doge sitting at a computer like a human with the caption "I Have No Idea What I'm Doing"? That's what comes to mind every time I picture notorious TE-hoarder Christopher Comstock setting his fantasy football lineup every week. The loss of last season's man behind the curtain, Ryan Irwin, has really hurt Diggs Gon Digg this season, and it's showing. I find it damn-near unbelievable that a team with Le'Veon Bell, Rob Gronkowski, Matthew Stafford, and Tevin Coleman (random name, I know, but he's tearing it up this year in that RBBC as the pass-catching back) are sitting in last place with a 1-6 record. While all 4 of those players contributed to the cause this week, the rest of the team refused to pick up the slack. Jamaal Charles was limited all week in practice, but our favorite risk taker decided to say fuck it and play him anywho. Kelvin Benjamin was greatly missed this week, and Stefon Diggs had an off game but that's aight cuz Diggs is dope af and can do whatever he wants shoutout to Stefon! Week 8 could prove to be a pivotal one as The Bortletortles come to town.</p>
