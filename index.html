                <p>The Butt Tuggers all but wrapped up their Week 2 match up a week ago tonight when Matt Forte shit on Chicago Bears fans every where with an amazing performance netting 3 touch downs and 29 fantasy points. Solid performances all around from the team gave him plenty of breathing room before having to mow the lawn mid day Sunday. But we’ve all seen this act before. It most certainly won’t last. Just as Dan has been dragging his friends down all their lives he will make sure to bring Forte, DJ, Kelce and co. with him.</p>

                <p>Speaking of, we might have just the man for the job. Or do we?  Quickly scrolling past the scoreboard you might think Forrest led his team to a respectable 111 point outing. Look a little further and you’ll see a bench that rivaled their chosen counter points putting up 110 points themselves.  Seriously, WTF is the point of WDIS Wednesdays? We will soon see if he has his wits about him to take Dan down in the biggest match up of the week. Honestly looking at this team pisses me off so much. Got to hand it to him though. 2 years ago he didn’t know what a football looked like. Fast forward to the summer of ’16 and his wife is walking in the door to find him watching preseason football and eating Chicken Wings. We have only ourselves to blame should this team rise to the top. </p>

                <p>Boy did I see the opportunity to play on some solid Mexican jokes just miss thetarget like Roberto Aguayo’s field goals. 4 points was the difference in this Week 2 match up against the Baja Men - two teams that quite frankly were trying to give the game away. But when I saw that Home Field Advantage might play a role in this outcome I couldn’t help but get giddy over the prospect of Mexican jokes. Oh well, another time maybe as Frank turned to his favorite geriatric to seal the victory with  yet another TD. Eric Decker, Julio Jones, and Larry should very well give Spread Sheets something to feel good about.   But two veryunderperforming QBs has already led to a waiver wire grab. And might lead to some shopping if things don’t turn around.</p>

                <p>The big dick of the week. Garett’s 128.5 would have been enough to easily dispatch any Week 2 opponent. It’s a decision that makes many fantasy owners cringe on draft night, but drafting the Broncos D early was the difference in this match up. 23 points, courtesy of 2 defensive scores, and Hester’s Hecklers didn’t stand a chance. And with Phillip Rivers adding 4 touch downs himself I caught up the player to see how the team was able to turn things around after the Week 1 defeat. "Snap chat. Seeing those pictures of our coach making those kinds of plays, it really woke us up. A lot of the guys kicked it up a notch after that. It was clear that Garett is a 5 sport athlete and super sick at football so we should be too." Rivers went on to add that it’s clear the bench players do not have Snap chat since they suck.</p>

                <p>A tough loss for the traveling sales man and his family (that also travels with him). An injury to Abdullah put his chance to continue undefeated in the rear view mirror. Although they technically don’t have a rear view mirror, but anyway...Toph’s team missed an outstanding opportunity to take their Diggs out slap them right in Forrest face.  Diggs clearly upset that he didn’t get the opportunity to play again his 2015 coach and it turned out to be a poor decision. The addition of Sam Bradford for the Vikings seems to quickly vault Diggs into a WR1 position and with Gronk sniffing the playing field and hopefully LeVeon not sniffing anything this team will be a force to reckon with moving forward. (Hopefully after Week 3 obviously)</p>

The bad news however is a team that doesn’t have the weapons it did a year ago. Rapey Ben, CJ Anderson, Zeke, and Marshall combined for 60 points and well that’s all he would need (honestly, his opponent scored 54.5 points but more on that later). If Chris wants to continue down of the path of repetition he better turn things around quick. His body is getting harder and harder but so is the competition in this league (yes, phrasing). RIP Paul Walker and RIP Dean Sampson. Give the people what they want. Captain Kirk is a champion. Dean is dead.</p>

Some hope on the bench with Corey Coleman was lost when the player broke his hand yesterday. Reports of the team having an after practice locker room gay party when Corey threw his hands in the air.  The break out WR’s hands were no match for the ceiling fan...</p>

I need to only assume that Woodhead was going to munch on some more points before ending his season and my dreams.Every manager wants to go 2 for 2. No better way to start things off.
