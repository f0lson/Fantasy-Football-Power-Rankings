                <p>When Forrest said he was changing his team name, many of us got excited, but the result left just as many of us just as confused as before.   Mac DeMarco is Canadian “Blue-Wave” artist for those, (all) who were wondering.  Anyways, CW suffered his first loss! That’s right, he’s beatable and in this year’s playoff one win is all you need to knock somebody out.  The top half of the lineup put up respectable numbers, but the bottom half disappointed. Marvin was starvin for receptions and only put up 4.5 points while the Cardinals D got pounded by the Panthers.  The biggest mystery may be how a kicker scores 0 points when his team puts up 19.  The door was left open and Kirk snuck in and locked it behind him for the win.</p>

                <p>The Butt Tuggers took poop on the Trumpster Fires in this matchup of 5-2 teams.  Iowa native David Johnson had only his third game this season under 20 points, but still put up a respectable 13.5.  Matt Forte showed that he still has some gas left in the tank with a 22 point showing and Gronk knock-off Travis Kelce added 19.5.  Tugg’s defensive woes continued with the Eagle’s -2 point performance, but defense wasn’t needed to top Frank’s turd of a team for the 113-78 final.   Tuggernuts plays The Bortletortles in week 9.</p>

                <p>Frank’s band of misfits had trouble finding points in the matchup against the Butt Tuggers.  The Packer’s decided to focus all their efforts and let the rest of the Falcon’s team beat them.  Greg Olsen was too busy babysitting other families’ kids and maybe touching them to put forth an effort against the Cardinals.  Speaking of kids Russell Wilson and Ciara are expecting! I however am not expecting much out of the hobbled QB the rest of the season.  Frank will be forced to lean on Wilson again for his matchup against the Dez Dispensers week 9 as backup Kirk Cousins is on bye.</p>

                <p>The QC Savages continue to be the standard of mediocrity in the league as they slide back into 4th place.  This week they were able to hurdle that 100 point mark that has been troubling them this season and beat the Dez Dispensers 107-93.5. Frank Gore and the Crow each grabbed 12 points and Michael Tree of Crabs was able to get 14.5 thanks to BWW sending the Raiders game to overtime.  Next week the Savages will be without 1st and 2nd picks DeAndre Hopkins and Lamar Miller, but who fuckin needs them?</p>

On a positive note, Tyler Eifert and Dez Bryant both look to be back and strong after spending much of the early season out to injury.

                <p>Don’t look now, but the Cleveland Steamers are in 6th place.  Consider me all aboard this steam powered hype train!  Tom Brady tossed a casual 29 points, which seems to be his average.  Sophomore Amari Cooper added his 29 points and Peaches proved that two running backs on the same team can produce with Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard adding 13.5 and 12.5 points respectively.  The Steamers will have to overcome HEAVY byes in week 9.  Like 6 positions on bye.  Surprisingly the squad should be able to fill in quite well with RBs Jonathan Steward and Jay Ajayi being available.  The red hot Steamers will look to continue their pace against the recently defeated Mac DeMarco Murray’s.</p>

                <p>WHO LET THE MUTHAFUCKIN' DAWGS OUT?! This is his world, and we're all just living in it. Manager extraordinaire Ryan and The Baja Men continued their climb up the #FuckDean power rankings. Waiver wire pick up of the week Ty Montgomery got things kicked off in a bittersweet fashion on Thursday night with 17 points against Ryan's beloved Bears. Leading the way in scoring this week was the great Eugene "T.Y." Hilton who balled the fuck out with 22.5 points, and the NY Giants D/ST chipped in with a fantastic 20 points of their own (cuz London, duh). Unfortunately, a Hunter Henry concussion cut his game short after only accumulating 1.5 points, but he looks healthy and good to go for Week 8. You have to respect the blind loyalty the Baja Men showed by deciding to play Jeremy Maclin once again even though the offense is dominated by Spencer Ware and the run game. Two in-form teams will square off in Week 8 as the Baja Men will be visited by the Cleveland Steamers.</p>

                <h2>Caleb's Lolnge:</h2>
                <p>The Bortletortoles suffered a heartbreaking loss at the hands of Diggs gon’ Digg.  Much like the puck hitting the back of the net, I did not see this happening.  The Bortletortles team had a good week aside from Jack Doyle and Cole Beasley.  Derek Carr had a career day passing for 513 yards and 4 TDs and Jordan Reed had 19.5 points on the bench. Dwayne has little reason to be discouraged.  After all, the Cubs are in the World Series and the Bears are back! Look for him to ride the positive energy to a win against the Butt Tuggers in week 9.</p>
