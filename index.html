                <p>Well well well... Look who caught their second loss. It seems as tho little Mr. Ranch can't handle the Chris's. The lackluster performance from such a powerhouse will keep the regular season title race close. Murray led the team with 14.5 points followed closely by Doug Martin. Cam Newtoff was hardly visible this week as he barely broke double digits. Maybe he spent too much time with the oriental background dancers to find his focus. With the way he has been performing this year, you can definitely tell he doesn't get vert. Hopefully Ranch can find his groove this week as he goes up against second ranked Tugg in the match of the week.</p>

                <p>Are you tugging my butt?! Mr. Butt didn't need any Luck this week as he put the paws on the Steamers. To be Blount, Butt used his big ol' Johnson to completely dominate this match-up as his heavyweight RB put up over 30 points. The new addition of Odell did not live up to the hype as he squeaked in a lousy 6.5 points. Hopefully the Butt's can keep this momentum as he is facing the number one Ranch's next in the highly anticipated match of the week.</p>

                <p>How the hell is Savage in third? Nevertheless, Mr. Savage handles the Bortortles with ease this week thanks to none other than his buzzin cousin of a QB. The 27 points he put up was the team high while his Lamer put up a respectable 17. I guess that's the only Miller Bortortles can stomach. Next week, Mr. Savage takes on the handsome Kirk The Lurk in what is expected to be a real barn-burner.</p>

                <p>Trumpster Fire has his Hyde handed to him in a Riddick-ulous upset. Russell tried to salvage what was a dismal performance from a strong contender this year with a solid 22.5 points, which was about what his two RBs put up combined. Larry Fitz really took a shit with 9 points. His manager should have traded him when he had the chance for what the league thought was an absolute steal. Hopefully this hot garbage can regroup as he faces The Bortletortles. </p>

Bryant put up a season high 23 points with Shady McCoy adding in 11 The real surprise came rom Matthews who scored 16.5. Mr. Dez thought he could have dispensed with the Lurk, but it seems as though he was destined to repeat.

                <p> The other Chris seemed to give his star players a stern talking to as both Bell and Rodgers put up 29 points, which was more than enough to hand Ranch his second L. As early as Diggs calls it a night, his team did not as everyone came to play, specifically Murray and Ebron as they spilled their Ranch on the Brotendos to really put this match out of reach (it's fun because Forrest is short LOL). Maybe it was all the Blue Guys or maybe it was all the rest, but Diggs finds himself on top this week and hopefully he can build on this momentum in hopes to really eat the Clams next week. </p>

                <p> TY to Mr. Tortles for Hilton as he put up the highest numbers on the offensive side for the Lurks this week. The Vikings D/ST added 22, making it easy to repeat on the Dispensers. Mr. Champaign was hot to trot this week as almost the rest of his team put up double digits. The Lurks playes as tho Leslie herself was at the game and added another win to their record, making playoffs seem in sight. And if we know anything about Lurk, it's that he is a late bloomer. Maybe this handsome, charming, cute, modest, and charming Lurk can keep his momentum as he faces the sleepiest squad in the leauge in his upcoming matchup with the Savages. </p>

His performances really built the wall for his team to utilize to all add respectable performances.
