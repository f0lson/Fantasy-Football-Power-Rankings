                <p><strong>King Wing’s reign continues.</strong>  The Ants in My Eyes Johnson’s, (TAIMEJ), got off to a strong start Thursday night where AJ Green looked like a man amongst boys against the Dolphins.  Running backs DeMarco Murray and Melvin Gordon added 24 and 20 points respectively.  Forrest’s team hasn’t put up less than 110 points in a single match this season.  How is this possible?  2 years ago he probably would have bashed the sport of football to no end and I would be willing to bet he’s never touched an actual football in his life.  Anyhow; TAIMEJ will be without WR Allen Robinson as they take on the 3-1 QC Savages next week.</p>

                <p><strong>Who left the fridge open?</strong> After a scorching start to the season, Tugg’s team was ice cold in week 4.  The Butt Tuggers put up a measly 73 points and were gifted 1 point for home field advantage.  They were outscored by 8 of the 9 other teams in the league, but that 1 team?  That was Toph.  I guess you could say the Butt Tuggers pulled this win out of their ass.  The team will be without WR Brandin Cooks and both rostered tight ends next week as they face the hungry Baha Men.</p>

                <p><strong>Julio bends Dean over.</strong> In case anybody didn’t hear, Julio Jones went fucking off on Sunday. 12 catches, 300 yards, and a touchdown. This amounted to 42 of the Trumpster Fire’s 130.5 total points, (32%). Only 5 receivers had ever surpassed 300 yards prior to this game. How does the defense let that happen?  Weren’t the Panthers in the Super Bowl last year? I miss Julio so much. Frank plays Kyle next week. Maybe he’ll lose again. </p>

                <p><strong>I thought I told you that I was a savage?</strong>  After pulling one of the scummiest moves in the history of the league, the QC Savages might find it more difficult to make trades happen in the future; however the team didn’t find it difficult to beat the lowly Cleveland Steamers on Sunday.  Demaryius Thomas had 18 points and old man Frank Gore added 16.5 in the win. DeAndre Hopkins shit the bed with a mere 0.5 points, while Crabtree harvested 29.5 on the bench.  The Savages will need to score more as a team if they hope to veto TAIMEJ’s run to a 5-0 record.</p>

The team was led by rookie sensation Will Fuller V with 23.5 points which is total fucking bullshit!  I am so stupid.  Ugh, do league member votes count for nothing?  I hate everything. Moving forward, Tyler Eifert will look to make his return in week 5 and Dez Bryant’s injury does not appear to be long-term.  Week 5 is tough week for byes as Rad will need to look for a replacement QB and a running back to fill in for Spencer Ware.</p>

The top scorer on the team was 2009 Heisman trophy winner Mark Ingram with 18 points, (Yes, 2009. We’re old.).  Ryan is going to have to whip his colorful group of replacements into shape if he hopes to turn the season around.  Next week’s matchup against the Butt Tuggers should be an instant classic.</p>

He dropped a top 15 running back to the waivers in week 3 and started the inactive Julius Thomas in week 4. Meanwhile his backup TE Hunter Henry racked up 14 points on the bench. I’m not making this stuff up!  Somehow this guy won the league last year!  While his team may not seem threatening right now; if there’s one thing Chris knows, it’s how to repeat.

Toph failed to capitalize on the Butt Tuggers sad performance and slipped to 1-3. Toph had 3 players and his Packers defense out on bye, but still should have been able to muster 75 points.  Le’Veon Bell put up 19.5, but that was the only bright point in the team’s otherwise poor performance.  Toph should have more success when Gronk gets to 100% and Jamaal Charles returns to the Chief’s backfield.  Toph faces Nate’s 2-2 Brown Trouts in week 5.</p>

                <p><strong>Cleveland Steamers continue to stink it up.</strong>  I had so much hope for my boy Kyle heading into the season.  Injuries have plagued the team; Adrian Peterson, Chris Ivory, Jonathan Stewart, Antonio Gates, Kevin White and Josh Gordon who noticed he was on the Cleveland Steamers and just decided to quit.  On the bright side, the god amongst mortals Tom Brady makes his glorious return this weekend against the Browns.  If there is any player that can salvage this team it’s Lord Brady.  Kyle works for a tech company so I have faith that he can figure out how the waiver wire works.  There’s still time for him to make his impact on the league.</p>
